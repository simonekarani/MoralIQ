# MoralIQ

Developed by Simone Karani

I call this app as "Are you Morally smarter than a high school kid?"

Moral IQ is an educational gaming path to analyze lifeâ€™s many ethical and moral dilemmas. The gaming app is built with dilemma-based scenarios with quizlet styled approaches, and providing human choices for those scenarios. The players have to choose which choice matters most to them. 

I have categorized my gaming system into five areas: 
1. General Dilemmas - general day to day dilemmas. 
2. Medical Ethics - ethical dilemmas that medical practitioners can come across, and the choices that they have to make. 
3. Tech Ethics - with an exponentially growing digital world, companies and new technologies present ethical concerns and the public must decide which ethical boundaries technologies should not pass. 
4. Business Ethics - dilemmas which arise for business leaders and the choices they make when deciding on heuristics. 
5. Moral Machine - AI engine-based self-driving car scenarios, where dilemmas exist in terms of how to deal with machines that do not have consciousness but will experience accidents and loss of human lives. 

No data is collected through the gaming application. The gaming score is generated to make the dilemma scenarios fun, with a perspective towards providing interesting analysis for ethical decision making. 

Results engine has been generated which provides a possible explanation for why the choice has been selected. 

To build the application:
1. Install Android IDE
2. Clone the git repo
3. Build and Run the application

Application is available on the Android App Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simonekarani.ethicaliq
